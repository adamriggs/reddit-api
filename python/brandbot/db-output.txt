For me, as I've gotten older, my car passion has gone through many forms. In high school and in the days before my license it was always about "the cars." All of them. I knew everything about every new high end car, and would talk people's ears off about them. (Ok, I'm still mostly guilty of these things) Then as I got my license it became more about driving and tinkering with my own car. Which basically surmounted to painting my brake calipers red and washing it twice a week. 

When I went to community college I got into autocrossing and as a result, motorsports. I bought my E36 M3 because of that interest, and because it had 140k miles on it, it taught me how to work on cars. Education through necessity. I took that car with me to "real college" and drove it everywhere. To school and back home, to race tracks, on aimless adventures in the country around my college town. I drove my girlfriend around in it the day after we met my junior  year, and we're still together. I fixed it when it broke, often at the worst times, in the beating sun or freezing cold. I drove it to my job interview before I graduated and I commuted in it my first year out of school. 

As I've graduated, and work, home life and building my life with my GF has taken precedent over loitering around the race track every other weekend, that car remains as my single connection to the car world. It is more than the sum of its parts. Not just sheet metal sitting in the garage, but the result of all my work, all the learning experiences, and all the good memories of the past 4 years of my life in a little yellow box.

Climbing inside and catching the smell of leather and a bit of old car must, twisting the key and hearing the straight 6 bark to life and settle into its monotonus idle, and clicking the shifter into gear brings me back to being 18 the day I drove the car home.

Living in the DC area you rarely get the opportunity to stretch a car's legs for any period of time. The car also has a myraid of issues that need to be addressed, so I haven't been able to drive it as much as it deserves lately, but I have been guilty of going down to the garage just to sit in the driver's seat for a few minutes after a long day at work. The last time I really got to drive it in its natural habitat was coming home from my Parent's house after Christmas last year: http://i.imgur.com/gDdhGh.jpg

I bought a GTI as a DD, and while it is a fantastic little car to drive, it means nothing to me. Its a machine, a laptop. I'm about as attached to it as my iPhone. I'll drive it for a few years and get another one. The E36 however is mine, and only mine. I'll give it a full restoration if it takes me 10 years.

For me, the car passion is all about a personal connection to a machine. I love hearing people's stories about their long term projects or whatever has capture their passion, whether its a six figure frame-off restoration, stripping out an old Ford Escort for a rallyx beater, or even slamming out some car and turning it into a show queen (even though I'm not a fan of that scene) if you're passionate about it and have put your own blood sweat &amp; tears into it, I respect it. 

What I don't approve of is the bench racing, spec-sheet pissing matches, and model hate that flies around seemingly all car communities. Don't talk shit on someone's project if all you've ever done is change the oil on your 2011 whatever.

Don't browbeat someone for buying a VW/Porsche/BMW/Merc/Saab/Fiat/Alpha/whatever because its unreliable. They know, they're the ones that own it, they don't need you looking down your nose at them from your Toyota-owning high horse. They're the ones shelling out the money and sacrificing the weekend time to own something they enjoy, what is the point of hating on them for it? 

Ok, that last rant may have specifically targeted my college club forum, but I feel better now.

To give some more context, that Audi is shooting a blue flame *probably* due to the sport exhaust pipes ~~turbo Anti-Lag System~~ (I honestly don't know if that car uses that system but that what the video seems indicative of.) 

turbo Anti-Lag System: 
It's very blue because fuel and air is directly being sent to the exhaust through the engine (aka oxygen rich) without ignition between shifts to keep the turbos spinning full speed. 

Edit: only saw the video before, listed again with headphones and noticed it was happening on the downshifts, aka more likely backfire than ALS. (If I am wrong please correct me.)

It's a sportback/liftback.  Most minivans have a flat tailgate.  It also doesn't have sliding (or particularly large) rear doors.  Its lines are more or less the same as all the rest of Audi's current sedans, if not a little reminiscent of the Porsche Panamera.  Minivans tend to be tall and boxy, to provide lots of interior space.  The A7 is sleek and has a coupe-like roofline (accented by the frameless windows).  I don't know where you heard that it was a van, but you certainly didn't hear it from Audi USA (who classify it as a sedan), or even the EPA, who call it a hatchback.  Modern minivans may have more sleek and aggressive styling, but they're still purpose-built for an entirely different market than the A7.

I can understand adding the modern A/C but I think the rest will look awful like its something out of Pimp My Ride. 

I think if you want to go the modern route, you should adapt a dash and seats out of a 2008-2009 XJ or something. Or, adapt the gauges and touchscreens into the original wooden dash.

&gt;What aspects about the market should I learn about/try to understand? 

* What cars you can find where and for what price, What cars you should be looking for. Example: In looking for something to swap for my Tiburon I dodge the "young" areas of town and instead search for classifieds in hoods where the retirees live (preferably with money) in hopes that I can find something like a Turboed Saab or maybe a BMW Waggon that's been here in their summer house spending most of it's time in a Garage (I Live in Miami Florida) I know that a Saab would be a good pick because they recently discontinued them but they are good reliable decently fast and semi luxurious. Same goes for the Bimmer waggon, Its got an I6, won't break easily and its RWD (plus plenty of room to shag in the back)  As you can see I'v given this plenty of thought :) 

&gt; I saw a suggestion about getting a Miata and putting a turbo on it to get it up to about 500hp. Would that fit into either category?

The Miata is definitely the second one! Another of my favorite cars! You can't beat the handling, Do a decent engine swap or both it and you have yourself an awesome rubber burner. The only reason I don't want one is that here in Miami they are all beat to hell, but if you can get one cheap enough its a really good pick. Parts are cheap, Easy to work on, and very respectable (you should subscribe to /r/Miata, someone from that group found a 99 for under 1K)

The RX7 its an awesome car but a bit harder to work on because of the wankel engine. That one looks amazing, shit If I was any closer I'd probably buy it between me and a couple friends. 

If you want to make it look prettier you will spend a LOT of money. Performance on old cars is always cheaper than looks, any decent paint job will run you about a grand, Wheels and tire another grand and then any body kits or whatever else that you wanna do to it will be expensive too. 

Performance wise you can make your own damn manifold if you have the tools, a 16G Mitsu turbo out of the junkyard costs a couple hundred, $200 for decent injectors, some ebay turbo accessories, a $300 Unichip to manage your new power and you should be close to 300WHP. (on a car that weights less that most Mustang drivers)  Plus you can always start cheap and go from there. 

No matter what the most important thing of all is to set yourself a goal and a budget and not go over them .....

&gt;-Where should we start?

I think you're on the right track. Getting some old car and starting to work on it is a great way to learn.

&gt;-What things should we learn beforehand? Are there books out there that we should read or online resources that we should check out?

Howstuffworks.com is a good resource for general car knowledge but you'll wind up doing most of your learning on the job. Make sure you get a variety of service manuals for whatever car you buy. The most popular are Haynes and Chiltons.

&gt;-How reasonable is it for us to work on a '67 Mustang as a first ever project car?

That's pretty reasonable. Generally speaking, an older car is going to be simpler. I started in on cars with a 1972 Plymouth Duster. The wiring harness to the engine was all of about 5 connections. I test ran the engine on the ground before I installed it by putting battery to the starter and pouring some fuel in the carb.

The issue is cost. A Mustang might be expensive; both original purchase price and for parts. If you guys are interested in older American cars and Fords look at the budget cars of the era. For Mopar, Plymouth Valiants and Dodge Darts and their sport derivatives; Plymouth Duster and Scamp, Dodge Demon/Dart Sport. The Ford Falcon and then Maverick and the Chevy 2/Nova for GM products. Those will have cheaper parts and will be easier to find. Look on [RockAuto](http://rockauto.com/) to price out parts. So pick a few random parts and start comparing them between different models.

For a project like this there are three main criteria; simple, cheap, and something you like. The first two make sense and the last is because there's no point in doing a project if you're not into it. A neat way to find cars is wikipedia's timelines, such as [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ford_vehicles#North_America) for Fords. You can look through at what they were making in what segments during what years. These are available for almost all auto manufacturers. Another good thing to look at is the support around the car. Go to the forums for that make/model and see how friendly the community is, how much technical info there is. Go on eBay/craigslist and see how much there is available for parts. Call up your local parts store and ask them if they have much on the shelf for it. The difference between a project that you can buy parts for at Autozone and one that you have to go to specialty online retailers is huge (and trust me, I've done both).

Some other good starter vehicles:

* Japanese cars: Mazda RX7, early Toyotas, Datsun (both Z cars and 510)
* European cars: Mk1 and mk2 VW Rabbit/GTI, BMW E30 and E28, Porsche 924/944 or 914 (more expensive parts), Alfa Romeo Spider
* British: Triumph Spitfire, old MGs (Midget, etc)
* American: The cars I listed above but look into the late 70s and 80s for the good cheap projects: F-body Mopars, Fox body Mustangs, 3rd and 4th gen Camaros, etc. If you're not set on a car, an old CJ6 or CJ7 Jeep could be a lot of fun.
* Very incomplete list, if you guys find cars you're considering feel free to post them here or PM me. Think about what you want to do with it, some of the cars I listed could be turned into an autox/track car relatively easily, some will have much better resale value, some could be good daily drivers.

&gt;-What is an ideal budget and how far off will we likely stray from said budget?

Depends what you guys have. Keep in mind the Rule of Pi: everything will cost 3.14x as much as you think it will and take 3.14x as long. Just don't stretch yourself thin on original purchase price and then have no money to put into it. I can assure you that you'd rather do a really good job on a cheap car than a cheap job on a really good car. Brakes will be $400, tires $500, and a full fluids change will be $100. There's $1000 just to do the minimum to make the car safe and that's all stuff you really shouldn't skimp on.

One thing I'll throw out there is that motorcycles are much cheaper than cars. You can buy an old Japanese bike for about $500, put way less money and time into it, and still have something pretty cool. For $2000 tops you can have a sweet cafe/like custom. If you guys want to do a project together you could each pick the same model bike and build them however you want. An old Yamaha XS, Honda CB or CX would be good bets. Check out [Bike EXIF](http://www.bikeexif.com/) for inspiration. PM me or bob over to /r/vintagemotorcycles for more info on that route.

&gt;-What would be considered a suitable condition for the old car we would get to repair/restore?

What area of the country are you in? If you're somewhere with inclement winters then rust will be your first enemy. Outside of that, look at what will cost you. Rust repair is expensive and time consuming, interior restoration is expensive (unless a cheap replacement interior can be found), in my experience engine and mechanical rebuilding is relatively cheap and enjoyable work anyway. Unless someone has receipts for recent work, assume that brakes will need to be done. Sometimes the expensive parts are the bits and pieces, finding a new chrome piece or so on and so forth. Try to find as complete a project as you can.

Edit: I'm in engineering school heading for a career in the automotive sector so feel free to message me or ask questions about that as well. I can distill most of my advice to one item though; DO FORMULA SAE.

The 944 *will* be trickier to work on in a few key areas. The vast majority of cheap 944s out there are being sold because they don't run or don't run right. These issues go back to their Bosch injection system (I believe it was L Jetronic pre '87 and Motronic after that). I have L Jet in my Alfa, it's tricky but not impossible. Many American mechanics are just very unfamiliar with it. (I think it would be fun to put a set of Weber carbs on one, that's always an option.) The 944 is also a transaxle car which adds a layer of complexity. That being said, they are still serviceable cars with a very cheap price of admission. You should be able to get into a project 944 for around $1000 and get a parts car for half that. Look into 914s as well, they're an earlier out-of-format Porsche (not a 911, basically) but still air cooled. For what it's worth, the 944 is one of the best handling cars of it's era and bang for buck probably the best handling car you can buy, with the MR2 in close contention.

The best project convertibles would be the Mazda Miata, an old RX7 or MR2, or (and I think we're getting close to the money shot here) a BMW E30. The E30 will be similar to the Porsche in driving characteristics and car feel but will be more reliable and simpler to work on. Also, convertible. The Alfa Spider is another cheap option that will be easy to work on. Look up pictures of an Alfa Spider that's been retroed back to metal bumpers and has the euro headlight covers, like [this](http://www.alfabb.com/bb/forums/attachments/spider-1966-up/259644d1349357363-headlight-covers-img_0922.jpg) or [this](http://www.alfabb.com/bb/forums/attachments/spider-1966-up/259622d1349328413-headlight-covers-img_1907.jpg). It really transforms the look of the car.

Thanks for your reply! I  hadn't looked at the early 70's 914, they look sweet and are probably simple to work on due to their age. 

I don't love the Miata, or MR2 I'm afraid, and the RX7 is ok. Funny you should mention BMW; my friend was telling me last week about how her family is trying to get rid of a 1986? convertible. She wasn't sure of the year/model, but is it worth looking into? 

I really like the Spider but I checked my local listings and could not find any in my price range (I have about $4,000 saved up at the moment). 

Without looking at 1960's American cars (Dad's choice), between an early 1970's Porsche 914,  a &gt;1985.5 944, and a 1986ish BMW convertible, which would be the easiest to work on? Those are probably my top choices for German cars.

That's the thing about Japanese cars of that variety; great cars, nothing wrong with them, but just nothing really right with them either. They just don't grab you. I joke that I should have bought a Miata but my Alfa was just too appealing, in all its rusty glory. That '86 BMW would be worth looking into. In order of ease of working on; 914, BMW, 944.

As for purchasing the Spider and most of these cars, the Alfa community is especially friendly. If you visit the big Alfa board, [AlfaBB](http://www.alfabb.com/), I'm sure you can find a number of neat projects in your price range. For example, [here's a good Spider for $3000](http://www.alfabb.com/bb/forums/alfa-romeo-cars-sale-wanted/208087-1974-spider.html) I found in their classifieds. If you're into the Alfas (as well you should be cause they're awesome cars) you should also check out Alfettas, GTV6s (I have one), or Milanos. These could all be had in your price range in varying conditions. Anyway, try checking out other boards for cars you're interested in. I'm sure there are good forums for most of the models we've been talking about. Many of those communities will take kindly to what you're trying to do. If you put up a wanted ad with a little introduction, sound friendly and willing to learn, you might be surprised at who comes out of the woodwork with cool projects.

If you haven't already, learn Craigslist boolean (google it for some tips) and save craigslist searches for what you're looking for as RSS feeds so you don't miss anything. Create an eBay account for saved searches and watch lists over there. Find your local classifieds papers/sites, the people that post there generally don't post anywhere else.

I will definitely check out the forums. A little while ago I was checking out a VW bus forum (before I realized how expensive older ones were and not fun to drive) and they were extremely friendly and welcoming to newcomers. I reckon the Alfa forums will be similar. 

Regarding the Spider, how big are they? I just realized this might be a problem, as I am 6'3. (My dad is 6'10, and probably won't fit in anything I get. Oh well, it will be me driving it, not him!) I think I can fit in the Porsches and BMW with room to spare but correct me if I'm wrong.

If you know nothing about cars, it's worth breaking them down into three steps:

* Drivetrain inc. engine
* Bodywork
* Everything else (brakes, suspension, electrics)

It is VERY hard to work on a project car that needs attention on all three areas, and Bodywork is by far the hardest. Most people getting their first project car think that the rust can be dealt with in a weekend with some spray cans. Once they've handed over their hard-earned for a 45-year-old body shell (like you're suggesting) they learn very quickly that dealing with rust is a long, laborious and *expensive* process.

Because of that, I'd suggest you'd buy anything you like as long as it doesn't have rust on it. You do not want the expense of welding and painting added to your budget.

I normally recommend 80s German cars for projects; BMW E30, Mercedes W123, old VW Golfs/Rabbits or the Audi 4000. Easy to work on, lots of spares available, and if you buy a base model then you can upgrade them with parts from the same family range. A four-cylinder E30 can easily be upgraded to a 6-cylinder model in a weekend, and the Audi 4000 can be boosted to a turbo unit from the 5000 fairly cheaply. 

You'll also learn more about modern cars than you will resurrecting an American dinosaur like a Mustang.

If it's two separate sets (different sides of the car) then I'd really suspect the amp.  And if it runs for short periods of time but fails during long usage I'd think it was over heating.  

I'm not familiar with the stereo layout of an MDX but I'd wager there's an external amplifier under one of the seats or in a cargo area quarter panel.

Nice ride dude.  6MT TL's are rarer than hens' teeth.  

Even manual TSX's are very hard to find.  I just bought an '06 TSX with Navi and it took me months to find one with low-ish miles and a non-frightening ownership history.  

Seems a shame that the vast majority of TSX/TL owners have no idea what a joy the manual gearbox is in these cars.  :/

yeah that kinda explains it. The acura bose stereos are lacking serious bass though. The good bose stereos that they put into nissans and GMs/Cadillacs POUND. This bose only plays the stuff not felt. Same with the ones they put in the first gen MDX. It just perplexes me how the sound can have such a dynamic range inside the car just by looking at the speaker's location, not to mention that its like under the armrest well below the passenger's ear. It sounds like it's right next to your ear though

Also, I am maybe considering an 07/08 maxima for the next car I get. I've heard the bose stereo in that car before.

I don't know whether or not your engine is an interference design (valves hit pistons with improper timing) or not. If it is, then I think you should go ahead and replace the belt in the near future. If not, then you may be able to get away with waiting for a while, as if the belt does fail the engine will just stop. On my TL the belt change interval is 105k...

I have these on my '08 TL, well a second pair.  First pair went just under 30k miles.  Due to a blown tire, life on the others, I forget the entire situation, I got them again (I think I got one free from Discount Tire).

I'd been following the TL maintenance indicator, but now I'm following strictly at 6,000 miles on rotation.  Just had my first rotation since the new set and they're doing MUCH better this time around.  Perhaps the longer rotation interval in the past caused the problem.

They're great tires overall, I'm in Chicago, and really like them in the snow too.

I have an 04 TL 6-speed. When I bought my car, someone had cross-rotated a set of BFGoodrich G-Force Super Sport A/S's, which is a unidirectional tire. I had TERRIBLE tire roar as a result. I switched to Uniroyal Tiger Paw GTZ's and have been incredibly happy with them. Michelin now makes BFG's and Uniroyal's, and mine have served me well thus far (plus they are relatively cheap). Plus they're not unidirectional, so you don't have to worry about that when rotating them...just check out the reviews. Hope this helps.

acura

The MDX has the same engine and other internals as the pilot, pilot sites not require premium, acura does. I used to interchange premium and regular, I prefer premium as it gives better mileage.



acura
c7f6yat
Acura
A 2008 mdx is not the same engine as the pilot it's the 3.7, and acuras have higher compression ratios 



acura
c7pwp2g
Acura
The compression ratio of the engine is listed in the owners manual.  In general 10.6-11.x or up, you need 91-93 octane.  10.4 and lower you can use 87-89.  I have a 2011 TSX K24Z3 11.0:1 compression and if I do not use premium gas the car does not accelerate as fast, it does matter.  Modern engines can retard the engine timing based on input from knock sensors.  It affects performance though.




acura
c7qefwm
Acura
No problem.  A lot of cars nowadays seem to have a 10.5 to 1 compression ration, and from what I can make out it's kind of a crapshoot what gas to use.  It's likely right on the edge where you could use 87 octane, but you might get slightly better performance out of 89 octane. My old Accord was 10.5:1 and I just put regular in it, since that's what it said in the manual.  I didn't play around with fuel types like I have with my Acura.  The Acura seems to like 93 octane gas from Shell or Mobil. Sunoco has 91 and I (think) I see a small improvement with the Shell.  But maybe I am just a car snob/performance tard.

I don't live in a cold climate (Los Angeles), but I do know the difference between tire compounds since I'm a huge fan of tires, brakes, and suspension.

Those cars were *definitely* not running similar tires.  I mean, sliding backwards on ice with snow tires?  That doesn't happen.  The Acura definitely had snow shoes on, where as the others probably had all seasons or summer tires.

*Edit: Yep, checked the video comments and I was right.  I'm somewhat disappointed, especially as an Acura owner.*



acura
c636i3f
Acura
&gt;I mean, sliding backwards on ice with snow tires? That doesn't happen.

I assure you it does happen. I have top rated winter tires on both of my cars and they will still slide when the road surface becomes icy. Also a 30% grade, as seen in the video, is **extremely** steep. A couple of the back roads I drive on in the winter have between an 18% and 20% slope. The steeper sections of these roads become impassable when iced over; even with AWD and snow tires. Only snowmobiles and vehicles with chains can make the climb.

I should have posted the [longer version of the video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YidkaqlW9ns) It suggests that all the vehicles shown climbing the 30% grade were on oem tires. Also please note that the 20% grade sign shown in the foreground refers to the slope to the left of the one featured in the video.

&gt;Edit: Yep, checked the video comments and I was right. I'm somewhat disappointed, especially as an Acura owner.

Don't trust YouTube commenters. And cheer up. I'm always skeptical of these manufacturer hosted test events, but in this case the claims appear legitimate.

I've never personally had issues with steep grades and ice, but I have had the pleasure of attempting to drive my TL in snow with chains. It did pretty well all things considered, especially since I had all seasons on underneath the car (decided to leave my soft compound tires at home so the cold won't affect the rubber).

However, I would love to see an STI or Evo in this situation; two cars built from years of testing in similar environments, they'd probably kill it on these slopes.



bmw
c63p37g
Acura
I agree that the Evo and the STI should excel at this test. They both have front **and** rear limited slip differentials. Even a vehicle with just one limited slip in the rear should also pass with limited difficulty. A well designed traction control system also helps but can't fully replicate the effects of a mechanical LSD

Several other expensive luxury/perfomance vehicles also have active rear differentials.  [Here's an X6 in the same split-mu situation:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znb_0RPS9Eg)


The whole point of this thread was to emphasize that SH-AWD is among the best systems on the market and certainly better than anything near it's price. This includes the Quattro system found in Audi's non perfomance models.



acura
c63rpqu
Acura
My TL has a fantastic TCS and Torsen-type electronic limited slip, and I can easily handle an icy 20% grade with the proper tires or chains. I can just imagine that the SH-AWD system is absolutely a blast to use compared to FWD, even if it is a Valtrex inspired AWD system with a FWD bias. The new TL comes with it, and it works really well in nearly all conditions. (you can tell if the new TL has SH-AWD by looking at the exhaust pipes; the SH-AWD model has a non-typical four tip layout).

Good to meet someone who is briefed up on their AWD systems. Upvotes.

Their service department is great and they're arguably the most reliable brand. So lower customer visits plus great service department is probably what brought their ratings up.

Sales departments at any dealership can be horrible @ /u/sichigo that's for sure.

It's hard to build a car while abiding the law so I'm not even going to comment on laws here. Go with what you think is right and assume everything is illegal. 



Now onto the systems, never heard of a header-back exhaust systems. I know for turbo cars these are often called Turbo-back systems. These systems do not have any catalytic converters, usually with down-pipe and mid-pipe included all the way to the muffler. Alternatively there is cat-back which starts after the catalytic converter (Most common with 1IS/2IS). Most people opt for cat-back systems and mix and match different mid-pipes (deletes the catalytic converter) and headers.



In terms of suggestions, depends on the look/sound/style you're going for and the kind of "hp gain" you're after (I put that in quote cause HP gain is debatable with aftermarket exhausts). IMO the so called header-back is pretty much pointless on a Lexus because it'll be absurdly loud and the droning will be unbearable. I would save my money and go with cat-back and maybe a mid-pipe.



lexus
ca83sfc
Lexus
I read on Club Lexus that the 02 IS300's have two catalytic converters: one at the header, one at the exhaust. Not sure if it's true, but since you are required to have a cat, an option is to maybe look at some of the high flow ones, but they can get noisy and I don't know what the gains may be. Even narrowing it down to one cat could throw off your sensors. As another one commented, I'd go with cat-back or mid-pipe also.

Yep, effse7ven is right. Ceramic tint has more heat resistance as well as UV resistance even at the lightest tint level. While regular tint is more so for privacy, ceramic tint will actually keep the heat out even if you do a very light percentage like 70-80%. 

I think it is a little more reflective at certain angles. It's pretty cool actually and makes the car kinda look like a Mercedes as they have some weird ceramic factory tint.

I don't have any links but I own a 2008 and can tell you a few things I like, what I don't like and things to look out for. I live in the south where potholes, bumps and rough spots due to red clay are very common. On a smooth road anywhere else it's like riding on a cloud. On a bumpy road, I am able to move around very nimbly to avoid them, the ones I do hit sometimes can be jarring if it was a bad one. On a rough road though my suspension makes noise. I do not know if that's just the way it is but nothing to bothersome.

I get great gas mileage, IF I don't speed around and put my foot off in it and drive normally. If I drive it normally I can get about 400-420 out of a tank, opposed to my IS I300 That would get around 325 to a tank no matter how I drove it.

The handling of the car is great. It's not an exotic sports car but its still a fun drive and sticks to corners and takes them rather easily. Make sure you get some good tires for it and your spare. I put Falken's on mine and its a good sport tire. I would rather have gotten some Fuzion Zri's but thrones I have now are great and compliment my everyday driving style very well.

As far as space goes, don't look to pile a lot of people in or any big people to sit well. I have a friend who is about 6'6 who sat in the front and had to put the seat all the way back. I dunno how many extremely tall friends you have but, there is that. The trunk is surprisingly spacious once you get things in there. The opening is narrow but the insideis quite spacious.

In mine, I like the interior but the plastic on the doors and on the srmrest seems a bit cheap. There are a few spot where i naturally rest my leg when I bend my knee that are starting to get faded and worn. The leather looks great but that's because I try and wipe it down a few times a month. 

For an IS to be short for 'Intelligent Sport', there is one thing that bothers me about the car. It is a push button ignition, which I love cause no more fumbling for keys to crank or having to take them out when its raining to unlock it. There is a sensor in the handle that knows you have the keys and unlock (sometimes). But, it's the fact I cannot leave the car running and take the keys with me and lock the car on a hot day or if I have my dog in the car and need to run into he gas station real quick. But, that's just a quirk. 

All in all, I love this car and love driving it every day. I believe you should enjoy driving an pd for me this car does it. I have not had any major repairs to do on it yet, knock on wood. For the price point this car is phenomenal. It has enough acceleration, speed and handling to make you feel like you have a sports car and enough nice so you can feel good on that sunny day listening to your favorite songs (which has a jack to hook whatever mp3player you have up) with the windows down and sunroof back.

Also, one quick thing because I noticed it on mine after I bought it. On the left and right sides of the windshield there is a rubber strip that deflects water. Make sure that does not dry rot and crack. It not only deflects water but will also reduce your wind noise on the interstate. It's nothing bad but just a little thing that can annoy.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask. One thing I love about Lexus as opposed to BMW and Mercedes is the fact that you can buy aftermarket parts is something needs replacing which makes the cost of ownership cheaper compared to the other two.

Heres my 2 cents. I am in Toronto, have an 06' is 250, and I love it. Few differences tho, mines auto, and is AWD, and has over 230K KM on her. She STILL rides like a dream. The rims have been the only issue iv seen or heard of. I used to work at a car wash and all the Lexus and Toyotas of this time the rims peel and flake really easy if not kept super clean. I like to think I am super meticulous about mine and they still have bubbles in some places.

Come winter time, I am always grateful of the AWD. Got stuck coming out of my quiet neighbourhood once this winter after one giant snowfall we had. It was right in the middle of the storm and the roads had not been plowed yet, and if didn't absolutely have to go out I wouldn't have.

You wont win to many drag races off the lights, but you will enjoy taking the corners to fast. Responsibly of course tho..

As Todd2point0 says space for tall people is a bit... awkward. Im 6'4 and the head space is tight for me. Also the back seats are no place for anyone over i'd say 6'. 

You wont regret it, they are beautiful cars.

Congrats on winning the PL, let's see how you guys do with Moyes next season. I see why you're buying a red car.



Now on to the car stuff. It looks like there's something wrong with the spoiler... why is it grey... 2006 with only 59.6k mi is pretty low only about 8-9k mi a year. And for 15k USD is a decent price. 2006 being the first model year there are a few things you have to look out for. You can find most [info here](http://www.clublexus.com/forums/is-second-generation/572768-buyers-guide-to-used-lexus-2nd-gen-is-models-merged-buying-advise-threads.html). Make sure all the TSBs are done. Just by looking at the pictures it looks clean. I would be extremely cautious buying from these kind of dealers. Here in US, these kind of dealers usually get their cars off auctions and if you're unlucky you might get a bad one. If it's a dealer you can trust, go for it. If not private sellers, dealerships, or even CPOs would be a great option. 



Things I would look out for: Since you're from Canada, rust would be the biggest concern. Not from Lexus dealer so the car could be involved in an accident, make sure all the paint matches. The ad didn't mention a single thing regarding Clean Title so it could be salvaged or been in an accident. The windows have been tinted, make sure they roll up and down properly. This car is a bitch to park with it's small windows and fat pillers, make sure the wheels are in good condition.


Hope it helps.

Because the Lexus IS is one of the most well rounded choice. Subaru Legacy GT, great motor, AWD but that's where it ends. I like Subarus especially how well they look with a set of Work Emotion CR Kais but the interior is probably more dated than your Camry now, and they're kind of pricey for what they are.


I'm sorry but the Infiniti G35 is not comparable with the two, sure it's a "Skyline" but it's big, bulky, doesn't look sporty at all and most importantly not a Lexus. Nice try but it's not. The 6 spd is nice and the way it sounds is nice but Nissan Performance? No thanks, I'd rather buy a 350Z if that's what I'm after. There's a reason why G35's have the worst resell value in it's class. Or if I'm looking for a luxury sedan that's not an IS, I'd pick a TSX or TL-S over a G35 all day everyday.


(Warning bias opinion ahead) IS or Lexus on the other hand is what I call the perfect choice if it's in your price range. Great resell value, sporty handling for what it is, Toyota reliability, timeless interior AND nice exterior (look at the original GS and LS, still looks great 20 years later), insanely quiet even with summer tires and AMAZING brakes, [the SXE10's brakes were compared to/better than the 360 Modena](http://my.is/forums/f87/is300-has-better-brakes-than-ferrari-360-modena-113982/). It may not be the fastest, but I don't think you'll look back and say I should've picked the Infiniti.

For me it was the perfect combo of comfort and fun to drive.  It was up against a Subaru WRX and a Jaguar X-Type at the time.  Each was too much of an extreme.  Besides the IS is the best looking.

Realistically, this car will last you well over 200k miles if you take care proper care (scheduled care) of it. I would say this is a typical dealer price so if you're a bargain shopper then no not worth it, but if you're a regular shopper don't mind paying market price then it's okay. The mileage is higher than most for a 7 year old car. It should have around 84,000 miles. A search on my local craigslist i found a 06 GS300 with 85k miles selling for 17,000 with Navi, bt, ipod heated seats clean title. 


Some questions to ask yourself is will your daily driving be able to offset the high mileage in the long run? ie: If it's 109k mi now in 4 yrs how many miles will you put on it? If you're going to put loads of miles on it then you might want to look into buying one with lower miles in order to keep as much value as possible. Cause when your car is 200k miles it'll only be worth $500 dollars or a tax write off. And with 91k miles to go it could be a concern.


**EDIT cause I saw your thread in r/cars: Stay away from the Sonata, it's a Lexus wanna-be. You'll be much happier with a real Lexus.**

I'm a Lexus owner and I would say that Hyundai's are good cars. If you're looking for a Lexus then buy a Lexus but if you're just looking for a good value then buy a new Hyundai for that price. It will last you longer than a 109k mile GS300 with a better warranty to boot.

I recently bought a very similar car - 2006 GS 300 with 95k miles. I'm the second owner and it was at the dealer for every single service. Just take your time and find a car that was well-loved. Stay away from cars with 3+ previous owners, frame damage, and you NEED a mechanic or trusted expertise to give it a neutral inspection.  

I took 5 GS300s to my mechanic before he blessed the one I bought. It was a long process and often frustrating, but once you find the right one, with regular maintenance, these cars should absolutely last you 200k+ miles. 

edit: also, one last suggestion, when buying used, particularly a car like this, hold out for absolutely everything you want. Don't compromise on anything. You'll find it, just be patient. 

The car I bought, when the original owner ordered it, had absolutely every option available. He paid a ton extra for the upgrades but it's essentially value lost or perhaps net wash when selling used. 

The options I held out for: AWD, Mark Levinson upgrade, back-up camera, navigation and I really wanted 1 previous owner that was from the same state as me. Some states are very environmentally (and car) friendly in terms of how they treat their streets after snowfall. Others are not at all and can cause substantial corrosion which makes any routine maintenance more expensive.

Thanks for replying!! And that's actually exactly what I did. I ended up buying the Lexus and I absolutely love it!! It only had one owner, it has AWD, Mark Levinson, back-up cam, navigation, and pretty much anything else you can think of. When this one finally gives out, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one. Only thing that is sort of a drawback is the gas prices because it doesn't have the best city mpg and it uses premium. Good Luck with yours!!

Kinda scared to say it around these parts...but I bet a bunch of people in the 300ZX Z32 community would be interested.  I'd put a big one up in my garage.  Specifically I have a 300ZX TT which OEM had a certain front end and spoiler that would be cool to get done in this style.  Kind of hard to find a good pic of a stock one at an angle like you have, but if you were serious, I'd find one [like this](http://www.skylinecityimports.com.au/web_images/1990-96-nissan-300zx.jpg) but at a little bit more of an angle like your M3.  Another interesting one is what colors to use as there's no standard color pattern for the Z's like the M3 logo.  I'd be willing to commission one for a little bit of money.  PM if interested, and maybe we could work something out.

Yeah I attempted that with my Vaders, and they were either too far gone or I wasn't patient enough with the process, because they fell apart 3 weeks later. I have seen refinishing done extremely well though. Neil1138 has an old thread on Bimmerforums where he restored his E46 coupe interior, jaw dropping work. 

E46 sport seats are relatively affordable, $300-400 depending on condition, i got the M3 seats for $500 which have the softer "Nappa" leather.

Yeah I was amazed when I found out the E46 M seats are so affordable, the Vaders are getting picked up by all the E30 and E36 guys for non-M cars, so the price of a set of clean black ones is absolutely insane. Like $1200+, anyone who's actually sat in a vader knows they're nothing special, so i was pretty happy to get a more supportive, functional seat for less than half of what I was looking at for direct replacements.

Yeah, If I was a baller I'd buy another set of the E46 M seats, convert them to AC power and install them in my living room. They are sooooo comfortable when you get the lumbar support *just* right.

I'm just sick of the hivemind mod mentality. 4-5 years ago you weren't cool unless you had Clears, AEs, a drop and ideally LTWs. Now you're not cool unless you're slammed on a tiny tire with ambers and city lights. 

I've been in the BMW world for 5 years, and the AEs have been installed in this car at least that long. Even if I didn't like them anymore, I'd leave them in just because of the sheer number of people that have given me shit for them in the past 12 months. 

For the record, you're the one picking fights in other people's threads, perhaps you're compensating for something yourself. The way you phrased it I assumed you were trying to get a rise out of me, I delivered. You could've just said you liked the car but not the AEs and it wouldn't have ruffled my feathers in the slightest.

Probably won't FI this car, I have a GTI as a DD that i can plug a tune into if I want to shred tires at 2300rpms. 

My long term motor dream is to go the "fully built" N/A route. Not a $20k motor or anything, but a set of ARP studs, Schrick or ideally Sunbelt Stage II cams, Miller WAR chip, 3.5in TB/MAF/Intake, full exhaust (already have everything but the midpipe), etc etc. Would put me around 300-320 at the crank with the sound and endlessly building powerband that only N/A provides. 

Right now the car is mostly acting as a garage queen. It took me ages to chase down and finally fix an SRS issue, only to get failed on safety inspection for the shitty connection at my long tube headers. It also has a seeping head gasket, blown out steering rack, leaky injectors and all the other stuff that only happens to a 180k+ mile car.

I'll probably pick up another midpipe, toss the stock headers back in and get it through safety so I can continue to drive it for a little while, then when I've saved up enough money, hopefully this winter, tear it down and do the head, steering rack, driveshaft &amp; rear subframe bushings, rebuild the interior (mostly done, just need to re-wrap and refit everything), run some new fuses out of the box for all the accessories I've added over the years, etc, etc etc.

Each one of the projects by itself isn't that bad, and could be done in a weekend, but since it needs so much unrelated stuff, and I finally have another car to daily drive, I'd like to just wait until I have the cash to do everything, tear down the car and rebuild it once and for all.

Maybe 10 years down the road when I can afford it I'll throw one of those Eurosport Twin Screws on it for the hell of it. I got a ride in an M coupe on the track with an S52 and that blower and it was a absolute monster.

Yeah, the Dakar is my garage-queen baby, the guy across the street with the M6 is a lifetime owner/enthusiast and hangs out when we wrench sometimes. 

I drove the M6 when we first moved in, its actually one of the few sold with a manual transmission, which, strangely enough, does a much better job at showcasing the dual roles of the car. Its a huge, heavy, luxurious coupe that also happens to have a crazed lunatic lurking under the hood. The SMG never gets out of crazed lunatic mode, always bucking and jerking and slamming gears, which is ever so slightly more excusable in the E46 M3, but completely pathetic in a full sized, six-figure luxury/sports car. 

The 3-pedal option allows you to drive it calmly and smoothly around town, your date could put on her makeup on the way to the show without being disturbed, and then you can make her eyeliner touch her ears on the way home.

She'd like to do the M bumpers and have one of the resonators cut out to make it rumble a bit more, but we have a higher priority to do list to get through first. 

We need control arms, thrust arms and front shocks, a couple oil leaks and maybe a persistent coolant leak (we just fixed the valley pan gasket last weekend and I keep finding little piddles, not sure if its just runoff from the messy project or another leak, but it is at least holding pressure) a window regulator, and another half dozen, really minor things. Then we can do the fun stuff.

Oil consumption is addressable. I've read fixes ranging from replacing crank case seal/ECU reflash to full blown piston ring or entire engine replacement. As jet life mentioned, these cars are known oil burners. No huge deal. 

The sensor is replaceable under Audi warranty. Not to bad of a fix anyhow; if needed fixed, replace the sensor and run the harness through Audi suggested grommet in the TSB. At a shop this should run $300-$400 tops.

Not really and depends. Depends on the coat of wax that is applied when the car is detailed, If its a good quality, thick wax (several layers) it will be like a wax paper, nothing gets stuck on it.


Well that said, normal washing..  In my opinion White cars are still better especially the White Polar that Mercedes and BMW has on their cars. When it rains or you drive in pot holes and get your car dirty, it will be noticed on dark colored cars (especially if pot holes filled with dirty water from rain). But with these kind of White cars, it turns from Polar white into Diamond White which is White but with a hint of darkness.



And here is the most exciting part that I like about my car when its dirty.. the wheels and fenders... The wheels will b like real dark titanium matt finish look and the fenders will have those sort of splashed backwards lines.. The car looks so freaking hot like its AMG with custom Dark Titanium Matt Wheels.. Gorgeous... (Drive it with triptronic - Done deal) .. or you could just clean it and drive it classy :P Your call.

Yeah, my brother and I bought a Mitsubishi Mighty Max (same truck) and wandered across the country with it, living in the back in a homebuilt pop up camper. So, very similar to what you're talking about doing. We had the 2.4L gas, if I recall correctly. We got 20 mpg for the whole trip, which was with a lot of weight. We saved it off a farm where the PO had put a cheap 3" shackle and puck lift kit on. It still handled most of what we threw at it. (Broke a spring during some enthusiastic off roading in Lincoln Nat'l Forest in NM.)

When we finally got out to the West coast the transmission was whining badly. My brother had the tranny rebuilt, I think it was just a bearing or two, and it's been his daily ever since and I bought a Comanche (another good option). It gets about 25mpg unloaded. Neat little truck, lots of personality. If I could find the TD version I'd jump on it. If you get the gas version you can swap all the DSM 4G63 based engines around so you could probably affordably change the engine with the oil. The transmissions were weak but ours lasted over 100k miles, took a few hundred for a rebuild, and will probably gives us at least another 100k.

yeah, I'd go as far as to say the stock wheels on the 96-97 EX sedan and wagon are the ugliest alloys Honda has ever made. I've always thought they were a total rip-off of [a 1980s Mercedes-Benz.](http://cdn.getauto.com/photos/0/156240/1c/WDBCA39D2JA418507-1c.jpg)

They were one of the first things I changed on my 97 EX sedan. Replaced by Acura CL wheels and then 3-piece Works.

5-speed is more fun to drive imo.  I have had a fully stock 06 type-s and 00 si.  EM1 is much more responsive throttle and handling wise.  Not so good on gas mileage over 60mph though.  Need that gsr 5th.

Are red flags. Means to me that he didn't bother taking care of shit unless the car broke down. Plus who knows how many real miles are on it.

I'm not completely pessimistic. I guess it could be a good car, just get a full diagnostic, most importantly a leak down test, from an independent mechanic. It does look a bit riced out and the fact that it is "slammed" means there is going to be a shitty ride. Depending on how long he had it like that and the condition of the road, you could have a horribly loud interior with shit creaking and rattling.

I'd personally stay away from it.

Just got mine a few days ago after totaling a stock 98 EK Civic hatch 5spd- now a proud owner of an unmolested white 96 Integra LS 5spd with 180k mi that I scored for $2600.  Needs some minor detailing work but good god I love that car already; those B series engines are great.

I bought the M Coupe for the wife, after having had the M3 for ~8 years. I'd been looking for a car that fit the bill for a few years when I found this one.

But it's sort of a trick question; the wife drives her Miata and the M Coupe sits in the garage.

Hell yeah PSS9! 

Those aren't the same cars in the first picture are they? It looks like they put on the M bumper and some ///M trim.

They've basically done what I've done to my car. Though I have a UUC EVO 3 SSK rather than the Z3 (which I think SlimKlim has). And my wheels aren't the same. And my car came with the E36 cross brace (convertibles all did).

And my clutch and flywheel are stock.

Oh and I guess I have the 7er tranny mounts rather than the UUC reds...

And I need to replace my brake lines...

I'm a hatch/wagon kind of person. But boring cars won't cut it - if it doesn't have a stickshift it's a deal killer Generally the more basic equipped the better - less to go wrong. If possible skip the sunroof, extra displays, power seats, etc.

So that means something like Ford Focus ST, Impreza WRX hatch, 5 door VW GTi, or maybe stretch a bit to the Acura Sportwagon. 

Which one would depend entirely on driving them back to back and choosing the one that was both the most fun to drive, and with the availability to be equipped in a way that I liked.

"A used M3 is not a good idea for someone who wants to dish out daily abuse and require reliability and good gas mileage"

-Me.

Seriously though, nothing against you, but that's a terrible idea and it almost sounds tongue-in-cheek. He didn't even mention horsepower or handling. Had he, I might agree. But the BMW parts tax (not to mention the M-Parts parts tax) would be pretty crippling to someone in the $30k (with kids) market.

He mentioned the Prius V.  Do you really think he wants an M3?  A standard 3-series would've been off the mark, let alone an M car of any kind.

Yea, "as a family utility vehicle"... you're advocating the M3 as a family utility vehicle?  Seriously?  Feel free to have your opinion, just state that your opinion is obviously way off from what he's asking.

The question is not to aid in his shopping. The question is just a general, "if you could have any car of type x, what would you buy." My answer can't be wrong, because it *is* what I would buy.

And yes, I am advocating the 4-door M3 that way.

You know, I have a question related to this. After happening to pass some of the baby car seats at the store last night, and noting their similarities to racing seats, and then reflecting on Jeremy Foley, who went off the side of Pike's Peak at 70MPH last year and he and his navigator survived a fall of hundreds of feet with only a broken leg between them, I have to ask: if we know that seats with 5-point harnesses, aggressive bolstering, and side bolsters that surround your head are undeniably the safest option, so much so that we demand these features by law for our infants, why do we still have car seats that look like living room furniture and allow you to flail around and get killed?

More troubling than the cost of the sensors themselves is that many of the controllers are completely proprietary and only dealers or certain very well-equipped shops can program them.

My 2008 Odyssey is like this. Frustratingly, the Touring model has a completely different TPMS system that can be programmed by the driver with a key+fob button sequence. But my LX requires a dealer trip for programming. The system fault warning light has been on since a few days after I bought the van (used).

Meanwhile a pocket tire gauge still costs a dollar or so. Progress.

if you going for reliability i fully get the LS swap. its a cost effective solution to a blown rotary engine. ill admit the thought of doing an LS swapped RX7 has crossed my mind, i doubt id do it in my current FD but maybe somewhere down the road if i got another one for a good price that wasnt a special ed of the car id do it.

in the rotary world its almost a fad to hate on V8 RX cars but the reality is its actually a pretty solid idea.

In my fantasy dream world where I make infinite money and broccoli tastes like french fries I've given this topic a lot of thought. 

In that fantasy world I think I'd rather an S54 than an LS1. An E36 should have a BMW straight 6. Anything else is just sacrilege.

EDIT:: Actually probably what I'd want is a Goddamn E36 M3 with the Euro S50 in it. Fucking American smog Nazis! You ruined it. You ruined it for everyone.

Nice!! I got the same feeling passing a newish E60 M5 in a 175k Miata at Summit Point. So great when you tail them, and tail them, and reel them in, and see that hand come out the window :-)

Are they letting you out there with a 'vert and no roll bar, or am I not seeing it? 

Car looks great!

My car has the rollover package. So there's bars in the back seats that pop up when the car rolls. That said it's still a little scary and the BMW club doesn't allow 'verts without full racing protection (roll bar + 5-point harness). I have to run with other groups that allow convertibles with factory rollover protection.

Mostly this. Not a ton going on in there really, just a lot of remembering where stuff went. Some basic sockets and snap ring pliers should to the job. It has been over a year since auto trans though, and Lexus is more of a "just replace it" type place now, so my memory is a bit worn.

Everything involving my 1982 Chevrolet C10 has been a battle, let's see if I can remember everything. Bought it as an ex-construction truck, so of course it had 7 leafs in the rear springs, manual brakes, a power steering pump that sort of works, a beat to hell interior, and a rebuilt and slightly modified 350 in place of the 305 it originally had.

1) Ripped out the old blue interior, swapped out the bucket seats for a bench seat, found out the driver side floorpan was rotted through, covered it with a rubber floormat. Plan on welding in a new floorpan in July, along with putting in a new dash, and eventually some carpeting to not make it be a deafening ride. (See below for why)


2) Removed the old Flowmaster exhaust, sounded bland and still had cats on it (don't need them in CT if it's 25 years old or more). Sheared all 6 bolts holding the exhaust on with 2 wrenches. Major choke point removed, was not put together very well. Bought 2 short Cherry Bombs and welded them to 2 feet of tubing, dumping them right blow the cab. Loud as hell, but it helped with performance, and I'll run a 45 or a 90 off of them and dump the exhaust off the side.


3) Rebuilt the carburetor and lowered the idle, as it would shift into 2nd while idling.


4) Replaced the spark plugs twice so far. Cylinders 7 and 8 are hidden behind the headers, making them almost impossible to reach. I have to climb into the engine bay to reach them.


First time 2 were completed shredded, as in the tip was straight, not over the electrode. Fixed the rough acceleration and cruising issues.


5) Dropped the transmission and put in a manual valvebody, along with a new torque converter. Dropped the transmission with the truck on the ground, then had the truck hauled to my grandfather's garage as it has a 2-post lift. Transmission stand/jack didn't work anymore, so we lowered the truck onto it. Then I forgot the S-clip between the shifter and shifter piston, so it had to go back onto the lift.


6) Last summer I got a new camshaft to put into it, which gave me a reason to tear the engine down. Had to cut out the center support in front of the radiator, because it was either that or remove the entire front end to get the old cam out. Front oil pan/timing cover seal was made up of RTV, hopes, and dreams. New one required dropping the front of the oil pan, while working entirely upside down, looking up from the bottom of the truck. Lifters went in fairly smoothly, and got everything all buttoned up nice. The marks I had made for the distributor were somehow horribly wrong, but resetting the engine to TDC and fiddling around with the timing made it work.


Now it just runs like shit. I think it's a combination of old fuel, crap in the tank, carburetor being out of whack now that everything's "fixed", but I can't check anything because the starter died again. Ran great for five minutes, then lost power, then puttered to a stop and wouldn't fire.
They don't call it a project for nothing.

There are rumors that Mitsubishi might pull entirely out of the American market. I honestly hope that doesn't happen. They are down on their luck and are not doing very well, but they should ride the "sporty" band wagon that is being revived with the BRZ/FR-S. We have talks of a possible new Supra and a new RX-7. It would be sick if they brought back the 3000GT flagship like Acura is doing with the NSX (even if the way they are doing it is blasphemous).
